### Problem 1

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The dataset shows NYC Transit data with information on entrances and
exits for subway stations. These data are not tidy because route and
route \# should be variables. We should convert `route` variables from
wide to long format. So far we have imported data, updated variable
names, and selected the columns to use. We updated `entry` from `yes` /
`no` to a logical variable. We specify that `Route` columns 8-11 should
be character. There are 20 columns and 1868 rows.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 465 × 2
##    station_name             line    
##    <chr>                    <chr>

There are 465 unique stations.

There are 84 ADA compliant stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
## [1] 0.3770492
```

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending that allow
entrance is 0.377.

### Problem 2

# Mr. Trash Wheel

``` r
mr_trash_wheel = 
  read_xlsx("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel")  %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  select(dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered) %>% 
  rename(dumpster_number = dumpster, weight = weight_tons, cigarettes = cigarette_butts, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls), name = "mr")
```

# Prof. Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trash_wheel =
  read_xlsx("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel")  %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  select(dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, homes_powered) %>% 
  rename(dumpster_number = dumpster, weight = weight_tons, cigarettes = cigarette_butts, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>% 
  mutate(name = "prof", year = as.character(year))
```

# Both Trash Wheels

``` r
all_trash = 
  full_join(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel) %>%
  relocate(name, dumpster_number) 
```

There are 641 observations and 15 variables in the final dataset. Some
of the key variables are the types of trash, such as glass bottles and
grocery bags, and homes powered. The total weight of trash collected by
Professor Trash Wheel was 190.12. The total number of sports balls
collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 was 856.
